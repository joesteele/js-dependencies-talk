# Suncoast.js JavaScript Dependencies Talk

These are the slides for the talk I gave on [May 28, 2014](http://www.meetup.com/suncoast-js/events/182747162/) at the [Suncoast.js meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/suncoast-js). The actual slides are in the [slides](https://github.com/joesteele/js-dependencies-talk/tree/master/slides) directory. The slides are powered by the HTML presentation framework [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) with a custom theme used.
